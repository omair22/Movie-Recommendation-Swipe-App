#### **Project Title**  
Movie Recommendation System Using Weighted Ratings  

#### **Overview**  
This project demonstrates a movie recommendation system leveraging a weighted rating mechanism. The system ranks movies based on user preferences and data insights, considering popularity, ratings, and relevance. It utilizes ratings from sources like **Rotten Tomatoes** for enhanced recommendations.

#### **Key Features**  
- Calculates weighted ratings using the IMDB formula.  
- Incorporates ratings and popularity metrics from **Rotten Tomatoes**.  
- Sorts movies dynamically based on user-defined parameters.  
- Visualizes trends in movie data, aiding in better recommendations.  

#### **Requirements**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `jupyter`  

#### **Dataset**  
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **movie_id:** Unique identifier for each movie.  
- **movie_name:** Name of the movie.  
- **runtime:** Duration of the movie in minutes.  
- **genre:** Genre(s) of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama).  
- **rating:** IMDB rating of the movie.  
- **director:** Director(s) of the movie.  
- **star:** Top cast members of the movie.  
- **gross(in $):** Gross revenue generated by the movie.  
- **movie:** The movie's name for display.  
- **description:** Synopsis or description of the movie.  
- **audience_score:** Audience score from Rotten Tomatoes.  
- **critics_score:** Critics score from Rotten Tomatoes.  
- **where_to_watch:** Platforms where the movie is available to watch.  
- **poster_url:** URL to the movie's poster.  
- **popularity_score:** Popularity score of the movie.  
- **release_date:** Release date of the movie.  
- **production_companies:** Companies involved in the movie's production.  
- **budget($):** Budget of the movie in dollars.  
- **more_like_this:** Other movies recommended that are similar to the current movie.  
- **release_year:** Release year of the movie.  
- **tags:** Extracted tags or key phrases from the movie's description.  

Ensure the dataset is uploaded to the same directory as the notebook or adjust the path accordingly.  

#### **How to Run**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```  
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook movie-recommendation-weights.ipynb
   ```  
3. Follow the cells in the notebook for data loading, processing, and recommendations.  

#### **Methodology**  
- **Weighted Rating Formula:** Adapted from IMDB's Top 250 approach, enhanced with Rotten Tomatoes scores.  
  - Formula: \( WR = \frac{v}{v+m} \cdot R + \frac{m}{v+m} \cdot C \)  
  - \( R \): Average rating for the movie (including Rotten Tomatoes).  
  - \( v \): Number of votes for the movie.  
  - \( m \): Minimum votes required for consideration.  
  - \( C \): Mean rating across all movies.  
- **Visualization:** Insights are presented via plots for better understanding.  
#### **Outputs**  
- List of top-rated movies based on the weighted score.  
- Graphical trends and insights into movie data.
 

#### **Customization**  
- Modify parameters like \( m \) or data filters to tailor the recommendation system to specific needs.
